Back in April 2024, the biennial Field-FX demoparty-in-a-field was fast approaching, and with no sight of an invite yet due to plans for the original invitation falling through, I thought I'd take up the task myself.
<br><br>
After just recently getting back from Revision Demoparty in SaarbrÃ¼cken, I was quite disappointed with the amount of AI generated art that was used in various productions, especially the Amiga demo compo.
<br>
This then got me thinking, how do I make a demo look like its definitely not using any AI graphics at all? Well, I can't draw very well, so the quality of graphics will surely be a giveaway.
And so I decided to hand draw all of the graphics along with the help of my good and long-time friend <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/130999/">Targz.</a>
<br>
<br>
We decided the Acorn Archimedes would be a fun platform to target for this, as Field-FX is a British demoparty, we were hoping at least a few people who saw it would go "Oh haha, I used to have one of those at home/school/college".
Created by Acorn in the mid 1980's to use their new custom ARM chipset, it's a machine not commonly seen outside of the UK.
<br><br>
We chose to target the Archimedes A3010, with a blazing fast ARM250 CPU @ 12MHz, 2MB of RAM, RISC OS 3.11 and support for up to 1.6MB floppy disks (I'll come back to this one later ðŸ˜‰).

<br>
<div class="d">
Shortly before starting the demo we had just finished polishing off a C SDK for the Archimedes, <u><a href="https://gitlab.com/_targz/archiesdk">here</a></u>, however by the time we realised we could've been using it, I had already written quite a few routines already in assembly language, and decided it was probably easier to just stick with assembly to avoid more faff and also keep the executable size down. In the long run this turned out to be a good idea.
<br><br>
We used the VASM assembler, Arculator emulator and started with a stripped back version of Kieran^Bitshifters <u><a href="https://github.com/kieranhj/proto-arc/">archimedes boilerplate</a></u> (thanks!), and fudged in the newest <u><a href="http://www.pi-star.co.uk/qtm/">QTMPlayer</a></u> for music playback.
<br><br><br>

<div class="f"><b>Choonz</b></div>

<br>
<div class="d">
The music for the demo was composed in OpenMPT and is in the MOD tracker format.
I thought since it was going to be released at a dutch demoparty, it might be a laugh to have a jaunty gabber happy hardcore-esque soundtrack, and this ended up working brilliantly as the audience loved it when it was shown.
</li>
</div>
<br><br><br><br>

<div class="f"><b>Graphics + Story(?)</b></div>
<li>
<br>
<div class="d">
And now for arguably the most time consuming part of the demo development. All of the graphics were hand drawn in Aseprite using a modified version of the <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/island-joy-16">Island Joy 16</a> palette, with a few colours given different indices to make swapping background colours during runtime easier.
<br>We used the Archimedes' MODE 9 video mode for the demo, 320x256 resolution with 16 colours. We did consider using MODE 13 (same resolution but 256 colours), but it really didn't need that many with the style we had in mind.
<br><br>One thing I really wanted to include was the sort of wiggly effect you get during animation where you draw over the same frame again and play it back. Since of course the drawing isn't going to be the exact same every time, so it gives it this little wiggle along all the lines, makes it look a lot more lively in my opinion. The effect can be seen here:
<img src="images/wavysun.gif" style="padding-top:20;padding-left:250;">
<br><br>
For the "story" of the invite, we went with the good old trope of people travelling from home to demoparty, with a lot of inspiration drawn from <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/25498/">Syntax 2009's Invitation by Disaster Area.</a>
<br>We had quite a laugh with the idea of the characters of the demo being gabber skinheads, once again since it was being released at a dutch party, we thought they might also find that amusing.
<br>And so, Aart and Vaart (BFFs 4 evaart) were born, here looking rather bored as they are stuck at home and not preferably out at a rave:
<br>
<img src="images/aartvaart.jpg" style="padding-top:20;padding-left:180;">
<br><br>
Since we didn't really intend of having a serious story, most of the ideas came while working on various other graphics, mostly in the form of "Wouldn't it be funny if [thing] happened?".
However we did storyboard a few things, in an unconventional way of merging stock images and drawing more inspiration from editing various memes:
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div class="f"><b>Code</b></div>
<li><br>
<div class="d">
As we wanted it the demo run on stock hardware from a floppy disk (via a Gotek drive), this soon started to become a challenge. Since we're lazy we decided the best bet was to just load everything into RAM in one go and then just execute everything there, to save faffing about with RISC OS's disk routines if we did want to load stuff from floppy mid-demo.
<br><br>
All of the uncompressed graphics ended up coming in at around 1.1MB, which some would say "Oh that's fine we have 2MB of RAM, that's plenty...", NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!1
<br>
Here is when LZ4 comes in to save the day, using some decompression routines I've had lying around for a good while (that I don't know where they came from, sorry!) that were ported from modern ARM over to ARM2.<br>However we did not use LZ4 compression for all of the graphics, only on ones larger than ~128x128 (I can't remember why we chose this specific size).
<br><br>
For each animated element I wanted at least 3 frames, as 2 looked too boring and 4 would take up too much memory. But "Oh no!" you say, "3 is not divisible by 2!!", correct, this is why on playback one frame is played twice. The frames for a single animation are played in order of 1-2-3-2, so then not only does it take 4 entries but also gives it a nice loop back to the start.
<br><br>
At the start of each "scene", all of the needed graphics are decompressed into one of four 40KB buffers per graphics binary file, and then from there they are read and copied to the screen.
I initially didn't want any slowdowns due to graphics decompression but this seemed to work well enough and is barely noticeable if you're not looking for it. (I've probably just ruined it now, sorry!).
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="b"><b>ARMed and Dangerous</b><br><br></div>
As most of the graphics' positions don't move, only the contents, we're able to use one of the ARM CPU's strong points, multiple register load/store. As an example, let's use a full-screen image (320x256) in MODE 9 (16 colours).
<br><br>
Each register can hold 4 bytes (32 bits), now we also need to reserve a couple of registers for the source and destination pointers, a counter, and then we also have to keep in mind of the program counter/flags, link register and the stack pointer (R13-R15).
<br>
That leaves us with R0-R12 free to do whatever we want with. If you're still desperate for extra registers you can store the stack pointer and link register elsewhere and restore them back afterwards, but I can't be bothered with faffing around with that.
<br><br>
This code below copies an entire screen's worth of graphics, our screen is 320 pixels wide and we can hold 4 bytes in each register, using 10 registers at once gives us 40 bytes. In MODE 9 with 16 colours, this equates to 80 pixels as each byte stores 2 pixels. So to copy a 320 pixel line of graphics we just have to do that 4 times.
<br><br>We start by loading the address of the screen into R11, and then the address of our graphics we want to copy into R10. We also use R12 as a loop counter.
<br><br>LDMIA (Load Multiple Increment After) loads R0-R9 sequentially with the data pointed to at the address in R10, the ! in R10! tells it to write back the address into the same register, and as we have appended IA to the end of the instruction, the address is incremented and then put back into R10.
<br>STMIA (Store Multiple Increment After) then stores the contents of those registers to the address pointed to by R11, and also increments and stores the value back into R11. That's quite a lot of work for just two instructions! Can your 68K do that? ðŸ˜‰

</code>
<br><br>We then loop through this 256 times (the heigh of the screen), and our full screen of graphics should now be copied to the screen. In a very reasonable amount of CPU time too!

These routines were used a LOT in the demo, often multiple copies for graphics of a certain resolution with the source pointers swapped out. This method however limits you in that there is no transparency (in reality I didn't want to use extra CPU time on more maths, and laziness ðŸ˜…). So this is why for most of the demo that graphics are always on a background of a single colour.<br>
<br><br><br>
<div class="b"><b>Take me down to the parallax city where the back moves slow and the front moves quickly</b><br><br></div>
For extra cartoony effect, and also because well, it's a demo, you need at least a couple of reasonably adequate effects, I thought parallax might be a fun idea, oh how wrong I was.
<br>As we are not an Amiga, we don't have bitplanes, sprites (Well, one, it's the mouse cursor), or any other fancy video registers to poke at, we just have a bitmap framebuffer. So how do we go about scrolling a portion of the screen?<br>
<br>In this case, we have a pointer to the second to last pixel on a given display line, we load a single byte, add one to the pointer, store the byte and then subtract two from the pointer. Now repeat that by the width of the display line divided by two (16 colours so 2 pixels per byte), fudge the first pixel in the line and move it to the last, and viola! You have just scrolled one line back by two pixels. And in this case I have multiple chunks of the screen with different speeds, which is managed by just skipping frames, the fastest running every frame, the next one every 2nd frame, the next every 3rd, etc.
<br><br>Now repeat this the amount of display lines you want to scroll and you have now realised how incredibly inefficient this is to do in a loop. Loop unrolling to the rescue!
<br><br>After unrolling as much as possible, around 248KB or about 30% of the demo is just for parallax. My excuse for it looking blocky is that the entire demo was made in about 3 weeks worth of all-nighters. There's probably a much better way to do it but it runs <i>just barely </i> in a frame's worth of CPU time, so there's no slowdowns ðŸ˜€ (Blue in border = Time used per frame).
<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<div class="b"><b>The Olympic Long Jump</b><br></div>
<img src="images/monkeys.png" style="padding-top:20;padding-left:180;">
<br><br>Now this is where things start to get quite ugly, at this point we didn't have long left to finish the demo, and we'd been adding everything into the same single source file, graphics data and all, just throwing stuff onto the end of whatever else we last worked on. This turned out to be a huge mistake. We had gotten to the point where it could no longer do long range address loads as the distance in memory was too far, a major restructuring was in order.
<br><br>We started off by moving the graphics a certain scene uses closer to the code of the scene that uses it. This solved most of it, apart from what I like to call the "Olympic Long Jump", where the last scene in the demo needed to be at the far end of the code, yet is called from the main scene "sequencer" far up the top. This involves jumping to a label which then jumps to another label further down, and then from there to the routine. This in my opinion is some next-level jank, but it works ðŸ˜‰.
<br><br>And so the demo was reaching the end of its development, it was the night before I left for the demoparty and all that was left now was to copy it to a disk and that's it, right?<br>Of course not, the demo won't even fit on an 800KB disk!
<br><br>
<img src="images/diskfull.png" style="padding-left:180;width:50%">
<br><br>Now the easiest solution here is to just use a 1.6MB disk, as ADFS (Acorn Disc Filing System) supports it, but that is too easy, this demo was going to fit onto an 800KB disk no matter what. So we started trimming down various graphics by a few pixels, code golfing a few routines, decreasing the sample length in a couple of the samples in the music, and shortening one of the decompression buffers.<br><br>After a whole night of optimizing, it was able to just barely fit onto an 800KB floppy, with a whole <b>10 bytes</b> left to spare. And an hour later I was off to get the plane over to the Netherlands for the demoparty, talk about down to the wire.
<br><br><br><div class="b"><b>The End?</b><br><br></div>
Would I ever make a demo like this again? No, but it was a fun experiment at least.ðŸ˜€
<br>The demo ended up doing quite well at Outline, achieving 2nd place in the Oldskool demo compo, and people were clapping along to the music and cheering at various scenes. So I'd call that a win!
<br><br>Special thanks to Targz for assisting with graphics and various other ideas, it definitely wouldn't have come out on time otherwise. Thanks also to the Bitshifters for programming and hardware advice and testing on different Archimedes systems when I couldn't!<br><br>Over n' out.
